# React Pagination App

This app uses React to paginate through lists of mock JSON data fetched from the API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. The instructions for building the app are laid out in the document 'Developer Test.docx' included in this repository. You will also find this app hosted on GitHub Pages to https://akomamathaino.github.io/dev_test/.

## Getting Started

To test this React app on your computer, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/akomamathaino/dev_test.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd dev_test`

3. Install dependencies using npm:

## Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app locally:
